## New Reddit update

This version of RedditHideAll hides any card on new Reddit, including in Classic and Compact mode, as well as detecting when you're still using old Reddit, and switching to the old hide method by examining the page URL. Using an external Reddit client? RedditHideAll can be used on other pages too, though it will warn of potential incompatibility.
